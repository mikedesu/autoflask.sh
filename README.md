# autoflask.sh

bash script that automatically creates a new Flask project folder

To run:

```
$ ./autoflask.sh <project_directory> <app_name>
$ pipenv shell
$ (app_name) FLASK_APP=<app_name>.py
$ (app_name) flask run
```

This is extremely bare-bones but is designed to start taking care of the initial heavy-lifting when creating a new project from scratch.

There are other things to be added here but this is a start!
